# Multi-Disease Prediction Web App

This is a web application that predicts various diseases such as **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease** based on user input. The app uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of having these diseases based on the provided health metrics.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in or sign up to access the app.
- **Disease Prediction:** Users can predict the likelihood of having:
  - Diabetes
  - Heart Disease
  - Parkinsonâ€™s Disease
- **Machine Learning Models:** The app uses pre-trained machine learning models for each disease prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
  - **Pickle**: For loading pre-trained machine learning models.
  - **SQLite**: For storing user data and authentication.
  - **Hashlib**: For password encryption.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning models.
  - **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Libraries**
  - **Streamlit-option-menu**: For building the sidebar navigation menu.
